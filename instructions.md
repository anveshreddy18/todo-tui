# Todo TUI Application Instructions

This TUI application helps you manage your tasks efficiently from the terminal. Below are the available modes and their controls:

## Global

## Normal Mode
- View your list of tasks.
- The cursor points to the current task.
- **e**: Edit the selected task.
- **Up/Down Arrow**: Move the cursor to the previous/next task.
- **a**: Add a new task (switches to addition mode).
- **s**: Switch to completed mode.

## Editing Mode
- Entered by pressing **e** on a task in Normal Mode.
- The selected task's name is preloaded in the input box for editing.
- Edit the task name as desired. Leave it empty if you want it to get deleted.
- **Enter**: Save the changes and return to Normal Mode.
- The task list will immediately reflect the updated name.

## Addition Mode
- Enter the name of the new task.
- **Enter**: Add the task (if input is not empty) and return to normal mode. If input is empty, return to normal mode without adding.
